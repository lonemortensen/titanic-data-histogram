# Titanic Datasets: Comparing Data
Selecting, comparing, and visualizing data with Python's NumPy and Matplotlib libraries.

## About
This project uses Python's NumPy library to first select, organize, and summarize data from the Titanic dataset (stored in a CSV file) for examination and comparison. The Matplotlib library is then used to create histograms to visually compare the data. The result is a comparison of Titanic fare prices and passenger survival rates to help determine whether it's possible to infer a relationship between the data.

## Project Background
The project was built as part of the coursework for Skillcrush's "Preparing & Displaying Data with Python" class.

During this project, I practiced: 

- Retrieving data from a CSV file and converting the data into a NumPy array. 

- Slicing (selecting) specific data from the NumPy array and using the flatten() function to convert two-dimensional arrays into one-dimensional arrays to make the data easier to work with.

- Using a for loop and if statement to organize the selected data into separate lists so the data can be compared. 

- Summarizing the organized data, using the mean() and median() functions, to allow for easier examination of the data.

- Creating histograms with Matplotlib to visually compare the data.
